# Errors

Inspiration:
* [Upspin](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2017/12/error-handling-in-upspin.html)
* [Build Web Application with Golang](https://astaxie.gitbooks.io/build-web-application-with-golang/en/11.0.html)

## Should we use the buildin go package or create a custom one which satisfy the standard error handling interface?

## Where we need them?

* API
* Balloon History|Hyper Tree
* Client?
* Server?

## What type of error we can handle?

## Current state

Currently we have a small ```errors``` package based on ```upspin.io``` way to handle errors.
